# Micro-Improvement Proposal - 2025-08-14

## Optimize TypeScript Configuration and Remove Remaining Type Issues

**Impact**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW | **Risk**: VERY_LOW

### Description
Complete the TypeScript optimization by fixing the last remaining type issues and improving the development experience. This micro-improvement focuses on cleaning up the final 'any' types and ensuring full type safety.

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Fix updateOrderStatus return type - COMPLETED
- [x] Add getPetAppointments and getPetFeedingPlans methods - COMPLETED  
- [x] Add proper type annotations for appointment and plan parameters - COMPLETED
- [ ] Remove any remaining implicit 'any' types
- [ ] Optimize interface consistency
- [ ] Verify all endpoints are properly typed

### Success Criteria
- Zero remaining LSP errors
- Full TypeScript compliance
- Improved IntelliSense support
- No runtime type errors

### Rollback Triggers
- Build process fails
- Any API endpoint becomes non-functional
