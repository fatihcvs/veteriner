# Daily Auto-Dev Proposal - 2025-08-14

## Fix LSP Errors and Enhance System Stability

**Impact**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Risk**: LOW

### Description
Resolve the 9 LSP diagnostics in server/routes.ts to improve code quality and system stability. This includes fixing type errors, missing properties, and implicit any types that could lead to runtime issues. Additionally, enhance error handling and improve development experience.

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Fix Property 'userId' does not exist on type 'never' errors
- [ ] Resolve Property 'getPetAppointments' does not exist issues
- [ ] Fix implicit 'any' type parameter errors
- [ ] Add proper type annotations for appointment and plan parameters
- [ ] Implement missing storage interface methods
- [ ] Update function signatures to match interface requirements
- [ ] Add proper error handling for undefined types
- [ ] Test all fixed endpoints with proper authentication
- [ ] Update TypeScript configuration if needed

### Success Criteria
- Zero LSP errors in server/routes.ts
- All API endpoints properly typed and functional
- Improved development experience with better IntelliSense
- No runtime type errors during testing
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Rollback Triggers
- Any API endpoint becomes non-functional
- Authentication system breaks
- Database queries fail due to type mismatches
- Build process fails
- Test suite has >20% failure rate
